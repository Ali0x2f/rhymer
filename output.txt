And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to crime
Moving like a mime
Taste like a lime
saving my nickels and dimes
I can read you like a sign

Hear my plight
Tell me what is in your sight
We don't ever have to fight
you're someone who I always liked
Make the wrong step and you'll get iced


I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe


Got them browns of hash


You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
